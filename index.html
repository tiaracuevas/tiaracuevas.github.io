        <p>Hi! I'm Tiara. I am a North Carolina Certified School Psychologist looking to apply my unique skill set to the field of coding.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>As a school psychologist, I have formal training in psychological assessment, behavioral interventions, behavioral research, and consultation. I take pride in my problem solving skills and my ability to identify creative solutions to unique challenges. I firmly believe in collecting and interpreting data to help guide decision-making. I thrive in collaborate situations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to my school psychology background, I have nearly a decade in customer service experience. I have also had the rare opportunity to help my husband start a small business. Through our business I have gained experience in graphic design, management, Word Press, Adobe Photoshop, Google Analytics, and collecting/analyzing customer data.</p>
